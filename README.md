Project Motivation
This project intents to classify messages sent at the time of disaster with the application of data enginnering on natural language and building a pipeline of machine learning for text data classification

App: alt text

Toolkit Used
This project was build on Python version 3.5 with NLTK library for text data engineering. Used re, pickle, sqlalchemy, numpy, pandas, sklearn from python.

Output
ELT Pipeline: Pipeline is to Extract, Transform, and Load process. Here, we read the dataset, clean the data, and then store it in a SQLite database after cleaning with pandas and processing using NLTK

Machine Learning Pipeline : After spliting data into a training set and a test set create a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV to output a final model that uses the message column to predict classifications for 36 categories (multi-output classification) and finally export your model to a pickle file.

Flask App : Dispaly results in a Flask web app with database file and saved model as input

Instruction
Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app. python run.py
